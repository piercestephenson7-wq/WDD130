                As a client, I was very satisfied with my finished website, thanks to Jacob. I chose the pictures and content for this page because it ties to it's purpose, which is to explain and show fun things to do in Rexburg, ID as a college student. I took pictures that were of activities to do here, and wrote about what the activity was. My lead developer and I communicated VIA email, which worked well, and he was always on top of things, so I never had many complaints. Next time, though, Maybe I'll be more specific of what I want. The less detail you put into a site plan, to more detail the developer has to come up with without your inspiration.

                Lead Developer Report
            </h2>
            <p>
                As a lead developer, I immediately got the contact info to email my junior developers, as well as communicated with them on Microsoft Teams. This worked well. I sent them the site plan, their assignment, and the content they needed to include. THen, it was up to them to do it. I mainly communicated with my client, Andrew, in class and over email. He only had a few tweaks he wanted to make, and there were some things from the site plan missing, so I had to reach out to him for extra help. Once I figured out how to GitHub, it was easy. I just sent him the limk and made sure to update it on GitHub each time I made edits.

            <h2>
                Junior Developer Report
            </h2>
            <p>
                On each of the projects where I was a junior developer, I made sure to contact them in person, but also get their info to make sure to ask for help over email. Once they finished their parts on the home pages, I asked them what I could do to make the subpages. The issues were only that it took time to develop the main page, so I was left waiting for that to happen, and for them to reach out to me. I didn't really know what they wanted me to do because they weren't very on top of things, and didn't reach out to me to let me know what my part would be. On each of my sites, I contributed by following the site plan the best I could, and made sure that, at least, if someone clicked the link to my page, it would show something relevant. GitHub was fairly easy to manage because it just came down to pulling and pushing origins everytime I wanted to make edits.

            <p>
                The most challenging part of all this for me was understanding expectations and communication. The programming itself was easy. As a lead developer, I felt that I did a good job making sure the juniors knew what to do and when to do it by, but that wasn't provided well to me as a junior developer. In the end, I just did what I could and hoped for the best. I really enjoyed working on real projects made by different people. It made it all feel more real, and made me excited to potentially develop websites for clients professionally in the future. If I were to go back in time and change something, I'd hold a real meeting with each person I was working with to make sure that we were on the same page (no pun intended) and had the same vision. I think this assignment really did prepare me to feel comfortable working with real cients, real teams, and on real projects. As long as we all work together and put in effort, the job will get done.
